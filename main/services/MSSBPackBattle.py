If you have less than 9 unique characters after opening your packs, you may use any 'Common' duplicates to fill out any remaining spots on your roster\n--If you draw a 'Star Token' and use it to star a character, that character is ineligible to pitch\n--If you draw an 'Extra Pack' consumable, you will get to open an additional pack to use for this game\n--If you draw a 'Reroll' consumable, you will be given the option to reroll your entire opening for 5 new packs and use that card pool instead\n--If you draw a 'Trade' consumable, you can trade one character in for a different character of the same rarity\n--Stadium and Home/Away is chosen by the player with more stadiums in their pack opening. You can choose any stadium that you opened. If there is a tie, choose from the stadiums shared by both player's collections and flip a coin/agree on who picks home or away.\n```"
